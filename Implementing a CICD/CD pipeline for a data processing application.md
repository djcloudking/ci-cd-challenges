### Implementing a CI/CD pipeline for a data processing application, using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, Docker, and Python

Here's a step-by-step lab for implementing a CI/CD pipeline for a data processing application, using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, Docker, and Python. This pipeline will cover all steps: automated testing, integration, and deployment with Docker containers, ensuring a reliable, consistent, and automated process.


1. **Setup: Create a Data Processing Application**

2. **Containerize the Application with Docker**

3. **Setup Version Control with GitHub**

4. **Configure Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**

5. **Integrate with GitHub Actions for Testing**

6. **Deploy with AWS CodePipeline**

7. **Run the Pipeline and Review Results**
