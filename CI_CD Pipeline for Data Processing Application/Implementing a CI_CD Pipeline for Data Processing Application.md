CI/CD Pipeline for Data Processing Application

In this lab, you'll create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for your data processing application that integrates automated testing, Docker containerization, and streamlined deployment using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and AWS CodePipeline. 

This setup should significantly reduce manual deployment errors and provide a consistent environment across development and production.


**1. Set up the development environment**
   
   - Install Python and necessary libraries for your data processing application
  
   - Set up a Git repository for version control


**2. Develop the data processing application**
  
   - Write the Python code for your data processing tasks
  
   - Create unit tests for your application
  
   - Ensure the application runs locally without errors


**3. Containerize the application**
   
   - Create a Dockerfile to define the application's environment
   
   - Build a Docker image of your application
   
   - Test the Docker container locally to ensure it runs as expected


**4. Set up a GitHub repository**
   
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   
   - Push your local code, including the Dockerfile, to the GitHub repository


**5. Implement GitHub Actions for CI**
   
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository
   
   - Add a YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`) to define your CI workflow
   
   - Configure the workflow to:
     
     - Run on push and pull requests to main branch
     
     - Set up the Python environment
     
     - Install dependencies
     
     - Run unit tests
     
     - Build the Docker image
     
     - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR)


**6. Set up Jenkins for additional CI/CD tasks**

   - Install and configure Jenkins on a server

   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job

   - Configure Jenkins to connect to your GitHub repository

   - Write a Jenkinsfile to define your pipeline stages, including:

     - Checkout code from GitHub

     - Run additional tests (e.g., integration tests)

     - Perform code quality checks

     - Generate reports


**7. Set up AWS CodePipeline for deployment**
   
   - Create an AWS CodePipeline in the AWS Console
   
   - Configure the pipeline source stage to connect to your GitHub repository
   
   - Add a build stage using AWS CodeBuild to:
   
     - Pull the latest Docker image
     
     - Prepare any necessary deployment scripts
   
   - Add a deploy stage to:
     
     - Deploy the Docker container to your target environment (e.g., ECS, EKS, or EC2)


**8. Implement automated testing**

   - Enhance your GitHub Actions workflow and Jenkins pipeline to include:

     - Unit tests

     - Integration tests

     - Performance tests

   - Configure the pipeline to fail if tests don't pass
