# Using AWS CodePipeline to create a CI/CD Pipeline


In this tutorial, I will create a simple pipeline between S3 buckets using AWS CodePipeline.

## Prerequisite

- Access to AWS account.

- Create a static website contents.


### Step 1- Create a S3 bucket as the source repository

•	Log in to your AWS account.

•	Go to AWS S3 dashboard.

•	Choose Create bucket.

•	In the next window, AWS Region is selected automatically.

•	Leave Bucket Type as General purpose by default.

•	In Bucket name, enter a name for your bucket (mine is demo-website-source).

 •	Scroll down in the configuration, and don’t make any changes until you reach versioning properties.

•	At the Versioning section, choose Enable versioning.

•	Scroll down and leave everything as default. Then click Create bucket.


## Step 2- Create another S3 bucket as the production repository

•	Repeat the same process as above.

•	In Bucket name, enter a name for your bucket (mine is demo-website-prod).

•	In Object Ownership, select ACL enabled.

•	In the bucket configuration, uncheck Block all public access this time.

•	Leave everything else by default.


Congratulations you’ve created two S3 bucket but the tutorial is not completed yet.


•	Now, go to list of S3 buckets. Click on the production bucket demo-website-production.

## Step 3- Add contents to the production bucket

•	Locate your website contents on your personal computer.

•	Create a zip package and name it demo-website.zip.

•	Go back to the S3 source bucket to upload website contents.

•	After uploading successfully, it’s time to create our pipeline.


## Step 4- Create a new pipeline via AWS Codepipeline

•	Go to AWS Codepipeline dashboard.
 
•	Choose Create pipeline.

•	In pipeline settings, add a name. Select pipeline type, service role, role name.

•	Check Allow AWS CodePipeline to create a service role so it can be used with this new pipeline.

•	Click Next.

•	In the source stage, add the source provider as Amazon S3; the bucket as demo-website-source; and S3 boject key as demo-website.zip.

•	Choose Amazon CloudWatch Events for detection options.

•	Click Next.

•	Skip the build stage. We don’t need it in this short tutorial.

•	In the Deploy stage, Choose Amazon S3 as Deploy provider, same region. Add demo-website-prod as Bucket.

•	Select Extract file before deploy.

•	In additional configuration, select Public-read for canned-ACL.
